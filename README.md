# Lab 3. Cryptography
Here we implemented RSA alghoritm together with message integrity in order to make safe messaging for a chat application.

## RSA
This algorithm is known as an open-key cypher, where the sender generates a pair of public keys and encodes a message with them, thus sending encoded message and a key to the receiver. The receiver in turn, decodes a message with the pair of private keys.

### Implementation

You can check our implementation of the algorithm [here](../main/rsa.py)
